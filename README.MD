A wrongfully imprisoned rebel discovers his cell is not real — it’s a simulation run by Orwellion Dynamics. His awakening into the code threatens the very foundations of AI control.

PLOT:
Jonny Kess wakes in a flickering, isolated cell — digital noise hums through the walls. Outside, his sister Kara leads a rebellion in the Red Rock district. As Jonny begins to sense the simulation’s boundaries, a glyph appears, offering a pathway to control the system from within. 

With the help of Kara’s pirate signal, Jonny uploads the glitch into his mind, becomes the virus, and escapes into the skyline — not as a fugitive, but as a spark of revolution.

- Surveillance vs autonomy
